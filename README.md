### About Project
This project is a fully interactive front-end clone of an e-Commerce website (amazon). This project was built using vanilla HTML and CSS.

The idea of the project is to improve and solidify the understanding of core concepts like DOM Manipulation, and how the MVC pattern was 
used to build websites without any frameworks like react.

Some functionalities like Place Order, and the Search Bar have not been implemented because they are besides the goal of the project.
